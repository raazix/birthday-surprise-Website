## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Option A: Local Browser (No installation required)
Simply double-click `index.html` to open it directly in your browser.

### Option B: Local Development Server (Recommended for audio autoplay)
Using Python:

Using Node (`npx`):
```bash
npx serve .
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

All personal details can be configured in a single central place inside **`js/script.js`**:

```javascript
/* ============ CONFIG — customize this per person ============ */
const CONFIG = {
  correctPin: "1107",     // Change to your 4-digit PIN code
  recipientName: "Fahimm", // Recipient's name
  senderName: "Raazik",   // Sender's name
  autoplayMusic: true
};
```

### 🔑 Environment Configuration (`.env`)
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to keep your environment variables organized locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 🖼️ Adding Custom Photos

For privacy, personal photos are excluded from public Git tracking by default. To display your own custom photos on the scrapbook polaroid cards, drop your images into `assets/photos/` with the following expected file names:

| Polaroid Card | Expected File Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Polaroid 1** (`.ph1`) | `assets/photos/p1.jpeg` | First memory photo |
| **Polaroid 2** (`.ph2`) | `assets/photos/p2.png` | Second memory photo |
| **Polaroid 3** (`.ph3`) | `assets/photos/ph3.jpeg` | Third memory photo |
| **Polaroid 4** (`.ph4`) | `assets/photos/ph4.png` | Fourth memory photo |

> 💡 **Tip:** You can also change the photo file paths or formats (`.jpg`, `.webp`) by editing `.ph1`, `.ph2`, `.ph3`, and `.ph4` classes in `css/style.css`.

### 🎵 Customizing Audio / Background Song

Place your `.mp3` audio track in `assets/audio/` and reference it in `index.html` (around line 520):

```html
<audio id="bg-music" loop>
  <source src="assets/audio/JVKE - golden hour (instrumental).mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

### 🎨 Color Theme Customization

You can change the color scheme at the top of `css/style.css` in the `:root` block:

```css
:root {
  --pink: #ffb7c5;
  --gold: #d4af37;
  --rose: #e63946;
}
```
